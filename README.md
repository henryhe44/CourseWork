### Description
This repository contains all of my coding projects/assignments from my college courses. 
* CSCI111: Introduction to Algorithmic Problem Solving
    * This is an introductory course to programming using C++ and generally the first course taken by Computer Science students.
* CSCI211: Object Orientated Programming in C++
    * Students dive deeper into what C++ has to offer while solving problems (i.e stable marriage, 8 queens, towers of Hanoi...) algorithmically. 
* CSCI212: Object Orientated Programming in Java
    * Java is taught in this course to build a "shopping cart". Every project builds up on the last and tacks on extra feature.
* CSCI313: Data Structures and Algorithms
    * The course covers maps, trees, heaps, and various sorting algorithms. It also teaches Big-O Analysis and Amortized Analysis.
* CSCI331: Database Systems
    * Students are introduced to T-SQL and Microsoft SQL Server 2016 to build databases, and taught concepts such as ER-Diagrams, Relations, and the Unified Modeling Language.
